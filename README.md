# the-basics

On this repository I'll cover some very basic programming structures (like loops, conditionals, functions, ojects, data types, etc).<br>
I believe that creating little scripts to play with those basic commands will help me remember more of advanced concepts of said programming languages.

I plan on writting on every new language I learn. So far, there's only Ruby (started learning a couple of days ago).<br>
If you're interested in my notes on programming languages I learn, check my [KeepNote repo](https://github.com/bored-user/KeepNote) out!

Stay safe, stay curious.<br>
Happy coding!
